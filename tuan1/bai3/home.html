        Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on
        rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have
        gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>
     <p>I've started putting up a slide show of the
        production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site.
        If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please 
        contact me.</p>
